**If you are reading this, I am currently looking for a Software Development role that enables me to work with Python and/or JavaScript (on the backend) and React.js or Angular on the frontend. I prefer either a position local to Chicago, IL or remote. If you have something that fits what I am looking for, please, send me a message via LinkedIn https://linkedin.com/in/muhammadjalloh and we will take it from there! :) **
